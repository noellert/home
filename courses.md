- Big Data and New Methods in Chinese Social History: Collection, Transcription, Analysis [(syllabus)][2]
- Analysis and Interpretation in Quantitative Historical Social Science [(syllabus)][3]

I am currently teaching an undergraduate Introduction to the History Major/Digital History Workshop at the University of Iowa:

- Digital History Workshop 2151/2195 [(syllabus)][4]
