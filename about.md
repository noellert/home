I am an Associate Professor of Asian Economic History at [Hitotsubashi University][2]. My research focuses on modern rural China, agricultural developments like land reform and collectivization, and social changes like communist revolution.

I was born and raised in a small town in southeast Michigan, received my B.A. (Asian Studies, minor in General Physics) and M.A. (Chinese Studies) from the University of Michigan, and then my Ph.D. (Humanities/Chinese History) from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Before moving to Hitotsubashi I spent four years teaching at the University of Iowa and two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Research Center for Chinese Social History][6] at Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.

While a student at the U of M I lived in a vegetarian student cooperative, where I was in charge of food and supply purchasing, and networked with farmers at the local market. After finishing my M.A. I joined [World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF)][1] and spent a year working on farms and learning Japanese in rural Japan. I have also lived and worked on farms in Northeast China, Hong Kong and the U.S.
